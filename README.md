# BinaryStringRevealer

 Program takes a binary string as input with masks (*) at random indexes.
 It will then output (to console or a file) all possible combinations of said binary string by changing 
 the masks to 1s or 0s. The first program uses recursion to do this and the second uses stacks. Program
 will also test running time of both algorithms.
